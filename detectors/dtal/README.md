## üìú Abstract

**DetectAnyLLM** is an **AI-generated text detection** (i.e., Machine-Generated Text Detection) model based on the [Fast-DetectGPT](https://github.com/baoguangsheng/fast-detect-gpt) framework, optimized using **DDL (Direct Discrepancy Learning)**.

DDL is a novel optimization method specifically designed for AI text detection tasks. It introduces a **task-oriented loss function**, enabling the model to directly learn the intrinsic knowledge of AI text detection during training. We found that DDL largely addresses the overfitting problem commonly seen in previous training-based detectors, significantly improving the generalization performance.

Additionally, considering that existing benchmark datasets lack coverage of proprietary LLMs and do not sufficiently address machine-revised texts, we propose the **MIRAGE** benchmark. MIRAGE collects human-written texts from 10 corpora across 5 domains, and uses 17 powerful LLMs (including 13 proprietary and 4 advanced open-source LLMs) to **re-generate**, **polish**, and **rewrite** these texts, resulting in nearly 100,000 high-quality human-AI text pairs. We hope that the MIRAGE benchmark will contribute to establishing a unified evaluation standard for AI-generated text detection.

## üî• News
- **[2025-07-17]** üéâ The code of **DetectAnyLLM** and the data of **MIRAGE** is released!
- **[2025-07-05]** üìù Our paper **DetectAnyLLM: Towards Generalizable and Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Text Across Domains and Models** is accepted by **ACM Multimedia 2025**!

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fjc2005/DetectAnyLLM.git
    cd DetectAnyLLM
    ```
2.  **Create and activate the conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n DetectAnyLLM python=3.12 -y
    conda activate DetectAnyLLM
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download necessary models:**
    ```bash
    sh scripts/download_model.sh
    ```
    > If you want to reproduce all experiments reported in our paper, please go to ```./scripts/download_model.sh``` and revise it following the guidance provided by common.

    > If you have trouble downloading, try to set the environment variable before downloading:
    ```bash
    export HF_ENDPOINT="https://hf-mirror.com"
    ```

## üöÄ Reproduce Results

### üöÇ Train DDL
**[GPU memory cost: ~11G]**
```bash
# Login to wandb
wandb login
# or
# export WANDB_MODE=offline
sh scripts/train.sh
```

### üìä Evaluation
**[GPU memory cost: ~15G]**

**Make sure you have trained DDL or downloaded checkpoints.**
```bash
sh scripts/eval.sh
```
The results will be saved in ```./results```.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Reproduce Other Methods
**Make sure you have downloaded all models in `download_model.sh`.**
```bash
sh scripts/other_method/eval_${METHOD}.sh
```
`METHOD` is the method you want to reproduce.

For example, to reproduce Fast-DetectGPT, run:
```bash
sh scripts/other_method/eval_fast_det_gpt.sh
```
> **Note:** To reproduce DetectGPT and NPR, you should run the following code first:
```bash
sh scripts/other_method/generate_perturbs.sh
```
