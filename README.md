# BRED

## Introduction

The `BRED` dataset contains several different AI-generated text datasets. Each file in this dataset corresponds to text generated by different large language models (LLMs) and various operations. 

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of the following seven files, each containing data used for different detection tasks:

- **cross-domain, cross-model, cross-operation**: out-of-distribution experiments
- **llm-va**: instruct v.s. base; small v.s. large experiment
- **reasoning**: reasoning v.s. non-reasoning
- **llm-co**: llm-crossover experiment
- **op-co**: operation-crossover experiment


### Example Data

An example record might look like this:

| id  | text                      | generated                | model   | operation | 
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------|-----------|
| 1   | "What is artificial intelligence?..." | 1 | gpt-4o  | polish        |
### Loading Data Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to load a Parquet file using Python and Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_json("path/to/your/data.json",lines=True)
data = pd.read_csv("path/to/your/data.csv")

print(data.head())
```
